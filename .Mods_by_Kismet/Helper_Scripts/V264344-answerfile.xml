MFA Strength Compliance Documented

The Xen Orchestra web server implements multifactor authentication (MFA) for privileged
account access with the following verified strength levels:

Authentication Architecture:
- Integration with Microsoft Active Directory via LDAP
- CAC/PIV card authentication enforced for administrative accounts
- Group Policy enforces DoD-compliant MFA requirements
- FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules in use

MFA Strength Verification:
- Privileged access (admin roles): CAC/PIV required (FIPS 140-2 validated)
- Standard user access: TOTP/hardware tokens or CAC/PIV
- Authentication factors: Password (knowledge) + CAC/PIV/token (possession)
- FIPS 140-2 validation certificates on file

ISSO/ISSM Approval:
- MFA implementation plan approved by ISSO: [Date]
- Authentication mechanism strength levels approved by ISSM: [Date]
- Security authorization package includes MFA strength documentation
- Exception/waiver documentation: None required (fully compliant)

Enrollment/Revocation Procedures:
- CAC/PIV enrollment managed via AD Group Policy
- Account provisioning/deprovisioning documented in SOP
- MFA token lifecycle management procedures established

This finding is marked as NotAFinding because:
1. MFA strength meets or exceeds DoD 8500.01 requirements
2. FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules are in use
3. CAC/PIV authentication enforced for privileged access
4. ISSO/ISSM have approved the MFA implementation
5. All required documentation is on file in security authorization package

Evidence: [Provide references to MFA policy documents, FIPS 140-2 certificates,
ISSO/ISSM approval memos, and security authorization package sections]

MFA Strength Documentation Required

The automated check detected authentication configuration on the Xen Orchestra web server,
but ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY REVIEW is required to verify MFA strength compliance with DoD
8500.01 requirements.

Required Documentation for ISSO/ISSM Review:
1. MFA Implementation Plan
   - Document MFA strength levels for each account privilege tier
   - Specify authentication mechanisms (CAC/PIV, hardware token, TOTP, biometric)
   - Map MFA methods to account types (admin vs standard user)

2. FIPS 140-2 Validation
   - Obtain validation certificates for cryptographic modules
   - Verify FIPS 140-2 compliance of all MFA components
   - CAC/PIV readers must be FIPS 140-2 validated
   - Hardware tokens must be FIPS 140-2 validated

3. Authentication Factor Types
   - Confirm at least TWO factor types implemented:
     * Something you KNOW (password/PIN)
     * Something you HAVE (CAC/PIV, hardware token, TOTP)
     * Something you ARE (biometric with liveness detection)

4. Privileged Account Requirements
   - Verify CAC/PIV authentication for administrative access (preferred)
   - If using alternative MFA: document justification and ISSM approval
   - Software TOTP acceptable for non-privileged access only

5. External Identity Provider (if applicable)
   - If using LDAP/SAML: verify IdP MFA strength compliance
   - Obtain documentation of IdP MFA configuration
   - Verify IdP enforces DoD-compliant MFA policies

6. Enrollment/Revocation Procedures
   - Document MFA enrollment process
   - Document MFA revocation/suspension procedures
   - Verify procedures align with account lifecycle management

7. ISSO/ISSM Approval
   - Obtain ISSO approval of MFA implementation plan
   - Obtain ISSM approval of authentication mechanism strength levels
   - Include approvals in security authorization package

Remediation Steps:
1. Review XO authentication architecture with system administrators
2. Collect MFA implementation documentation
3. Verify FIPS 140-2 validation certificates
4. Document MFA strength levels per account type
5. Obtain ISSO/ISSM approval of MFA configuration
6. Update security authorization package with MFA strength documentation

Organizational Context:
- XO may integrate with Microsoft Active Directory (LDAP)
- AD Group Policy may enforce MFA via Kerberos/NTLM with CAC/PIV
- SAML/SSO may delegate authentication to external identity provider
- MFA strength must align with account privilege level per DoD 8500.01

Note: This finding remains Open until ISSO/ISSM verify and document that MFA strength
levels meet DoD requirements based on account privilege levels. Technical detection of
MFA configuration is NOT sufficient for compliance - organizational policy review required.
