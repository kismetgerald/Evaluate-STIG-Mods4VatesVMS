COMPLIANT: File integrity monitoring and alerting configured for audit logs.

System demonstrates compliance through:

1. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) Implementation:
   - FIM tool installed and configured (AIDE/Tripwire/OSSEC detected)
   - All audit log locations monitored (automated checks verified)
   - Log file protection enabled (immutable/append-only attributes)
   - Auditd watch rules configured for log directories

2. Real-Time Alerting Configuration:
   - FIM alerts configured for unauthorized log modifications
   - ISSO/SA notification mechanisms tested and verified
   - SIEM integration active (Splunk/QRadar/ArcSight)
   - Alert thresholds properly calibrated

3. Organizational Integration:
   - Documented response procedures for log tampering alerts
   - 24/7 SOC monitoring of FIM alerts
   - Incident response procedures include log tampering scenarios
   - Periodic testing of alerting mechanisms (quarterly minimum)

VERIFICATION EVIDENCE:
- FIM configuration files with log directory monitoring rules
- Alert test results showing ISSO/SA notification &lt; 5 minutes
- SIEM integration documentation with log tampering event correlation
- Incident response procedure documentation
- Auditd watch rules for /var/log directories

This system meets DoD requirements for immediate alerting on unauthorized audit log changes.

REMEDIATION REQUIRED: Implement file integrity monitoring and alerting for audit logs.

Steps to achieve compliance:

1. Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):
   - Install FIM tool: apt install aide (recommended for Debian)
   - Initialize AIDE database: aideinit
   - Configure AIDE to monitor ALL audit log locations:
     * /var/log/xo-server/
     * /var/log/nginx/
     * /var/log/journal/
     * /var/log/audit/
   - Edit /etc/aide/aide.conf and add:
       /var/log/xo-server p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+sha256
       /var/log/nginx p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+sha256
   - Set monitoring frequency: Configure cron job for hourly checks

2. Implement Log File Protection:
   - Set append-only attribute: chattr +a /var/log/xo-server/*.log
   - Verify immutability: lsattr /var/log/xo-server/
   - Configure auditd watch rules:
       echo "-w /var/log/xo-server/ -p wa -k log_tampering" &gt;&gt; /etc/audit/rules.d/log-monitoring.rules
       echo "-w /var/log/nginx/ -p wa -k log_tampering" &gt;&gt; /etc/audit/rules.d/log-monitoring.rules
   - Reload auditd: augenrules --load

3. Configure Real-Time Alerting:
   - Configure AIDE email notifications in /etc/aide/aide.conf
   - Install mail utilities: apt install mailutils
   - Configure SIEM integration for auditd events (syslog forwarding)
   - Set alert thresholds for unauthorized modifications
   - Configure /etc/rsyslog.conf for remote logging:
       *.* @@siem.organization.mil:514

4. Test Alerting Mechanism:
   - Simulate log tampering: touch /var/log/xo-server/test.log
   - Verify AIDE detection: aide --check
   - Verify ISSO/SA receives alert within 5 minutes
   - Document test results

5. Document and Integrate:
   - Create incident response procedures for log tampering
   - Include in organizational security monitoring processes
   - Schedule quarterly testing of alerting mechanisms
   - Brief ISSO/SA on alert handling procedures

VERIFICATION EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- FIM configuration files showing log directory monitoring
- Alert configuration files with ISSO/SA contact information
- SIEM integration documentation (syslog forwarding rules)
- Alert test results (simulated tampering with verified ISSO notification)
- Incident response procedures for log tampering events
- Quarterly testing schedule and results

DoD Requirement: Immediate alerting to security personnel when audit logs are modified without authorization.
