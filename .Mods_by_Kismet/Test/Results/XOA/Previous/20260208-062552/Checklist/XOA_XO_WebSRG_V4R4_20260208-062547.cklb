Edit: /opt/xo/xo-server/config.toml or /etc/xo-server/config.toml\n    - Locate [http.cookies] section or create if missing\n    - Set timeout and rolling based on system risk classification\n\n(2) DoD Risk-Based Timeout Requirements:\n    - High Risk (Classified, PII, critical systems): 5 minutes (300,000 ms)\n    - Medium Risk (Unclassified sensitive): 10 minutes (600,000 ms)\n    - Low Risk (Public-facing, read-only): 20 minutes (1,200,000 ms)\n    -

The web server must employ NSA-approved cryptography to protect classified information from those individuals who have no \"need-to-know\" or when encryption of compartmentalized data is required by data classification.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70271","V-56017"],"ccis":["CCI-002450"],"reference_identifier":"2910","uuid":"b1bb3dec-e99a-4970-baeb-9258b9f325f3","stig_uuid":"daafa65b-58f2-4b29-ad69-b6d6ee9d7e07","status":"open","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 02/08/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 2\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nThe automated check found that Xen Orchestra is NOT using FIPS-validated cryptographic modules, violating STIG SRG-APP-000289-WSR-000071 requirements for compartmentalized data encryption in DoD Classified environments.\n\nThis is a CRITICAL finding if this system will handle DoD Classified information. FIPS 140 compliance is mandatory for:\n- DoD Secret/Top Secret data protection\n- Key derivation functions\n- Cryptographic algorithm selection\n- Cryptographic module certification\n\nNon-compliance findings:\n- OpenSSL FIPS mode not enabled\n- Non-FIPS algorithms in use (MD5, SHA1, RC4, DES)\n- Node.js crypto module not linked to FIPS OpenSSL\n- Cryptographic module not NIST-certified\n\nRemediation steps:\n\n(1) Verify current cryptographic configuration:\n    node -e \"console.log(require('crypto').constants)\"\n    openssl version -a  # Should show \"FIPS\" in output\n\n(2) Install OpenSSL FIPS module (if not present):\n    # For RHEL/CentOS/Debian:\n    apt-get install libssl1.0.0-fips  # Debian\n    yum install openssl-fips  # RHEL/CentOS\n\n    # Verify FIPS module: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1/fips.so\n\n(3) Enable FIPS mode in Linux kernel:\n    # Check current status:\n    cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled\n\n    # Enable FIPS (requires dracut-fips package):\n    fips-mode-setup --enable\n\n    # Reboot to activate:\n    systemctl reboot\n\n    # Verify after reboot:\n    cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled  # Should show 1\n\n(4) Rebuild Node.js with FIPS support (if needed):\n    # XO may need Node.js rebuilt with FIPS module support\n    # Contact Vates for FIPS-enabled XO builds\n\n    # Check if current Node.js supports FIPS:\n    node -e \"console.log('FIPS:', process.versions.openssl.includes('fips'))\"\n\n(5) Update XO configuration to use only FIPS algorithms:\n    # Edit /opt/xo/xo-server/config.toml\n    [http.tls]\n    ciphers = \"ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384\"  # FIPS only\n    minVersion = \"TLSv1.2\"\n\n(6) Verify FIPS algorithms in use:\n    openssl list -cipher-algorithms | grep -i \"aes-256\\|sha256\\|ecdsa\"\n    openssl list -digest-algorithms | grep -E \"sha(256|384|512)\" # Only these allowed\n\n(7) Validate FIPS compliance:\n    # Test that non-FIPS algorithms fail:\n    echo -n \"test\" | openssl md5  # Should fail: \"Digital Envelope routines error\"\n    echo -n \"test\" | openssl sha256  # Should work\n\n    # Test FIPS TLS:\n    openssl s_client -connect [XO_IP]:443 -cipher \"AES256-GCM\" 2>/dev/null | grep Cipher\n\n(8) Document FIPS configuration:\n    -

Create security operations procedure (SOP) for log review:\n     - Purpose: Regular review of centralized audit records\n     - Scope: All systems forwarding logs to SIEM (including XO)\n     - Frequency: [Daily/weekly based on system categorization]\n     - Responsibilities: [Security analyst role]\n     - Escalation: [ISSO/ISSM notification procedures]\n\n  2. Define review checklist:\n     - Authentication failures (failed login attempts)\n     - Privilege escalations (role changes, permission modifications)\n     - Unauthorized access attempts (access denied events)\n     - System errors and anomalies\n     - Security alert review (SIEM-generated alerts)\n\n  3. Document in security plan Section [X.X]\n\nStep 2: Configure SIEM for XO Audit Record Review\n  1. Create SIEM dashboard for XO:\n     - Authentication summary (successful/failed logins)\n     - User activity timeline\n     - Error rate trends\n     - Security events (privilege changes, configuration modifications)\n\n  2. Configure saved searches for common review queries:\n     - Failed authentication attempts (last 24 hours)\n     - Privilege escalations (last 7 days)\n     - Unusual access patterns (logins from new IPs/locations)\n     - System errors requiring investigation\n\n  3. Schedule automated reports:\n     - Daily summary email to security team\n     - Weekly detailed report to ISSO\n     - Monthly trend analysis\n\nStep 3: Train Security Personnel\n  1. SIEM platform training:\n     - How to search XO logs in SIEM\n     - How to interpret XO log events\n     - How to correlate XO events with other system events\n     - How to export findings for reporting\n\n  2. Incident response training:\n     - When to escalate findings to ISSO/ISSM\n     - How to document review findings\n     - How to initiate incident response procedures\n\n  3. Document training completion\n\nStep 4: Implement Regular Review Process\n  1. Assign security analyst responsibility:\n     - Primary reviewer: [Name/role]\n     - Backup reviewer: [Name/role]\n     - Escalation contact: [ISSO/ISSM]\n\n  2. Create review schedule:\n     - Daily: Quick check of critical alerts\n     - Weekly: Detailed review of authentication and privilege events\n     - Monthly: Trend analysis and comprehensive review\n\n  3. Document review findings:\n     - Use ticketing system or log review spreadsheet\n     - Record date, reviewer, findings, actions taken\n     - Archive review reports per retention policy\n\nStep 5: Test and Validate Review Process\n  1. Perform initial comprehensive review:\n     - Review all XO logs in SIEM for past 30 days\n     - Document baseline (normal activity patterns)\n     - Identify any existing security issues\n\n  2. Perform test incident simulation:\n     - Generate test security event (e.g., failed login attempts)\n     - Verify event appears in SIEM\n     - Verify review process detects event\n     - Verify escalation procedures work\n\n  3. Validate review completeness:\n     - Confirm all XO log sources reviewed\n     - Verify no log gaps or missing data\n     - Test log retention and retrieval\n\nRe-run scan after centralized review procedures documented and implemented.\n\nNote: DoD requires centralized review and analysis of audit records from multiple system components per NIST SP 800-53r5 AU-6(1).

SAML/OIDC with DoD Identity Provider:\n   - Integration with DoD-approved IdP (Azure AD + CAC, Okta + YubiKey)\n   - IdP enforces MFA with separate device before issuing assertion\n   - XO trusts IdP authentication decision\n   - Centralized MFA management\n\n3. OAuth2 Proxy with MFA Gateway:\n   - Deploy oauth2-proxy or similar in front of XO\n   - Proxy integrates with MFA gateway (Duo, Azure MFA, etc.)\n   - Users authenticate with password + separate device (phone, token)\n   - Proxy validates MFA before forwarding to XO\n\nNON-COMPLIANCE RISK:\nMFA without a separate device factor (e.g., password + security questions) provides\nweak protection.

Documentation of password list updates (change logs, audit trails)\n6. Testing procedures to verify compromised password blocking\n\nMANUAL VERIFICATION PROCEDURES:\n\n1. Review organizational password policy:\n   - Verify policy requires maintaining list of compromised passwords\n   - Verify organization-defined update frequency (e.g., 'at least annually')\n   - Verify acceptable sources for compromised password lists\n   - Verify procedures for integrating new compromised passwords into enforcement\n\n2. Review implementation method:\n   - For LOCAL authentication: PAM pwquality with dictcheck/dictpath settings\n   - For LDAP/AD authentication: Directory service password policy (delegated)\n   - For custom implementation: Scripts/tools that check passwords against lists\n   - Verify implementation blocks passwords matching compromised list\n\n3. Review compromised password list sources:\n   - NIST Special Publication 800-63B Appendix A (banned passwords)\n   - HaveIBeenPwned Pwned Passwords database\n   - CISA/NSA guidance on commonly exploited passwords\n   - Organizational intelligence (passwords from incidents/breaches)\n\n4.

Implementing a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation information via the network.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","ccis":["CCI-004068"],"reference_identifier":"2910","uuid":"bc702b5d-d6c3-40c2-9a1c-0e7d396d6331","stig_uuid":"daafa65b-58f2-4b29-ad69-b6d6ee9d7e07","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 02/08/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_WebSRG_Checks) was unable to determine a Status but found the below configuration on 02/08/2026:\nResultHash: 1B1A04CFBAAFA69F47CB7BC56F3347F86F8D4271\n~~~~~\nThis check requires manual review of Xen Orchestra web server configuration.
