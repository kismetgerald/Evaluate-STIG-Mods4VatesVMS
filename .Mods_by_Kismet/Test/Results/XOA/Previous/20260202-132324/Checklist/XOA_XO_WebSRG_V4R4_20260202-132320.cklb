Edit: /opt/xo/xo-server/config.toml or /etc/xo-server/config.toml\n    - Locate [http.cookies] section or create if missing\n    - Set timeout and rolling based on system risk classification\n\n(2) DoD Risk-Based Timeout Requirements:\n    - High Risk (Classified, PII, critical systems): 5 minutes (300,000 ms)\n    - Medium Risk (Unclassified sensitive): 10 minutes (600,000 ms)\n    - Low Risk (Public-facing, read-only): 20 minutes (1,200,000 ms)\n    - Default recommendation: 15 minutes (900,000 ms)\n\n(3) Enable rolling sessions (required for inactivity timeout)\n    - Set rolling=true in config.toml\n    - This resets timeout on each user activity\n    - Without rolling, sessions expire after fixed duration regardless of activity\n\n(4) Determine system risk classification\n    - High Risk: Manages classified VMs, contains PII, critical infrastructure\n    - Medium Risk: Manages unclassified sensitive VMs, general admin access\n    - Low Risk: Read-only access, non-sensitive VM monitoring\n    - Coordinate with organizational ISSO/ISSM for risk determination\n\n(5) Verify Redis session TTL updates on activity\n    - Monitor Redis: redis-cli MONITOR | grep sess:\n    - Perform user activity (click, API call)\n    - Verify Redis session TTL is reset (EXPIRE command)\n\n(6) Test inactivity timeout enforcement\n    - Authenticate to XO web interface\n    - Remain idle (no clicks) for timeout duration\n    - Verify session expires and re-authentication is required\n    - Test that activity (clicks) resets the timeout\n\n(7) Restart XO server to apply changes\n    -

User logs in at 09:00\n  - Session expires at 17:00 (8 hours total)\n  - Activity does NOT reset absolute timer\n  - Forces re-authentication after 8 hours regardless of activity\n\nBoth timeouts work together:\n  -

CAC/PIV SMART CARD + PIN:\n   - DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card\n   - Smart card reader required (separate device)\n   - PIN entered on system keyboard\n   - FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module\n   - PREFERRED METHOD for DoD environments\n\n2. HARDWARE OTP TOKEN + PASSWORD:\n   - YubiKey, RSA SecurID, or similar hardware token (separate device)\n   - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) or HMAC-based OTP (HOTP)\n   - Password entered on system\n   - Token generates cryptographic code independent of system\n\n3. MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR APP + PASSWORD:\n   - Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile (on smartphone)\n   - Smartphone is the separate device\n   - TOTP codes generated on mobile device\n   - Password entered on system accessing XO\n   - Acceptable if smartphone meets org security requirements\n\n4. BIOMETRIC (on separate device) + PASSWORD:\n   - Fingerprint scanner on CAC reader or USB device (separate hardware)\n   - Facial recognition on approved biometric device\n   - Password entered on system\n   - Biometric device must be FIPS 201 compliant\n\n5. FIDO2/WebAuthn SECURITY KEY + PASSWORD:\n   - YubiKey 5, Google Titan, or FIDO2-certified security key\n   - USB/NFC security key is the separate device\n   - Password entered on system\n   - Public key cryptography, phishing-resistant\n\nUNACCEPTABLE MFA IMPLEMENTATIONS (Not Separate Device):\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1. SMS TO SAME DEVICE:\n   - SMS code sent to smartphone used to access web server\n   - FAILS separate device requirement (single point of compromise)\n   - Also vulnerable to SIM swapping and SS7 attacks\n\n2. EMAIL TO SAME DEVICE:\n   - Email verification code accessed on same system/device\n   - FAILS separate device requirement\n   - Email account compromise defeats MFA\n\n3. SOFTWARE TOKEN ON SAME DEVICE:\n   - OTP app installed on same computer accessing XO\n   - FAILS separate device requirement\n   - Malware on system can steal both password and OTP seed\n\n4. KNOWLEDGE-BASED AUTHENTICATION (KBA):\n   - Security questions (mother's maiden name, first pet, etc.)\n   - Not a separate device\n   - Vulnerable to social engineering and data breaches\n   - NOT acceptable as second factor\n\n5. PASSWORD + DIFFERENT PASSWORD:\n   - Two passwords or passphrases\n   - Same authentication factor (knowledge) used twice\n   - NOT multifactor authentication\n\n================================================================================\nMFA STRENGTH ASSESSMENT\n================================================================================\n\nAUTOMATED CHECK COMPLETE - MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED\n\nAutomated checks CANNOT determine:\n- The type of MFA implementation deployed\n- Whether the second factor is provided by a separate device\n- Compliance with organization-defined MFA strength requirements\n\nManual ISSO/ISSM review is MANDATORY to verify MFA strength.\n\nMANDATORY MANUAL VERIFICATION:\n\n1. MFA MECHANISM IDENTIFICATION:\n   - Document the exact MFA mechanism used for XO authentication\n   - Identify both authentication factors (e.g., password + CAC)\n   - Verify one factor is provided by a SEPARATE DEVICE\n   - Confirm separate device is not same system accessing XO\n\n2. SEPARATE DEVICE VERIFICATION:\n   - For CAC/PIV: Verify smart card reader is separate USB/integrated device\n   - For OTP token: Verify hardware token or smartphone app used\n   - For FIDO2 key: Verify USB security key is separate from computer\n   - For biometric: Verify biometric scanner is separate hardware device\n   - Document make/model of separate authentication device\n\n3. FIPS VALIDATION (for DoD systems):\n   - Verify MFA device has FIPS 140-2 validation (CAC, YubiKey FIPS, etc.)\n   - Obtain FIPS validation certificate number\n   - Confirm cryptographic module meets DoD requirements\n   - Check NIST CMVP validation list: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program\n\n4. NIST SP 800-63B COMPLIANCE:\n   - Verify MFA meets Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) requirements\n   - AAL2: Requires possession and control of two distinct factors\n   - AAL3: Requires hardware cryptographic authenticator (CAC, FIDO2 key)\n   - Document AAL level achieved by current MFA implementation\n\n5. ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY ALIGNMENT:\n   - Review organization's MFA strength policy\n   - Verify XO MFA meets or exceeds org requirements\n   - Document approved MFA methods from org policy\n   - Confirm any exceptions or waivers are documented and approved\n\nREQUIRED EVIDENCE FOR AUDITOR:\n\nSystem Owner/ISSO must provide:\n- Detailed MFA implementation documentation with separate device specification\n- Screenshots of MFA login process showing separate device usage\n- FIPS 140-2 validation certificate for MFA device (if applicable)\n- NIST SP 800-63B Authenticator Assurance Level determination\n- Organizational MFA policy specifying acceptable authentication mechanisms\n- User training documentation on proper MFA device usage\n- MFA device inventory and lifecycle management procedures\n- Evidence of periodic MFA effectiveness testing\n\nIMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\n\nFor XO deployments, the MFA separate device requirement is typically satisfied by:\n\n1. LDAP/AD Integration with CAC Authentication:\n   - Active Directory configured for CAC/PIV smart card authentication\n   - XO delegates authentication to AD via LDAP\n   - CAC reader is the separate device\n   - Meets DoD PKI requirements\n\n2. SAML/OIDC with DoD Identity Provider:\n   - Integration with DoD-approved IdP (Azure AD + CAC, Okta + YubiKey)\n   - IdP enforces MFA with separate device before issuing assertion\n   - XO trusts IdP authentication decision\n   - Centralized MFA management\n\n3. OAuth2 Proxy with MFA Gateway:\n   - Deploy oauth2-proxy or similar in front of XO\n   - Proxy integrates with MFA gateway (Duo, Azure MFA, etc.)\n   - Users authenticate with password + separate device (phone, token)\n   - Proxy validates MFA before forwarding to XO\n\nNON-COMPLIANCE RISK:\nMFA without a separate device factor (e.g., password + security questions) provides\nweak protection. If both factors are on the same device or in the user's memory,\ncompromise of that single element defeats MFA. Separate device requirement ensures\nan attacker must compromise BOTH the user's knowledge (password) AND physical\npossession of a separate authentication device."},{"group_id_src":"V-264345","group_tree":[{"id":"V-264345","title":"SRG-APP-000830","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-264345","severity":"medium","group_title":"The web server must, for password-based authentication, maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords on an organization-defined frequency.","rule_id_src":"SV-264345r984380_rule","rule_id":"SV-264345r984380","rule_version":"SRG-APP-000830-WSR-000190","rule_title":"The web server must, for password-based authentication, maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords on an organization-defined frequency.","fix_text":"Configure the web server to maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords on an organization-defined frequency.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the web server is configured to maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords on an organization-defined frequency.\n\nIf the web server is not configured to maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords on an organization-defined frequency, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"Web_Server_SRG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"UNCLASSIFIED","discussion":"Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they are used in single-factor or multifactor authentication.

A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","ccis":["CCI-004909"],"reference_identifier":"2910","uuid":"b02086fa-5ab1-4243-bcbb-69e2d67cb441","stig_uuid":"5c72bac4-5e87-403f-b113-110008e9d512","status":"open","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_WebSRG_Checks) found this to be OPEN on 02/02/2026\nResultHash: 95C2961B7ABBB4A99C69048BE440566091A327D6\n~~~~~\nCheck 1: System CA Certificate Store\n--------------------------------------------------\n   [FOUND] Certificate store: /etc/ssl/certs\n   [NOT FOUND] No DoD-related certificate files detected\n   [FOUND] Certificate store: /usr/share/ca-certificates\n   [NOT FOUND] No DoD-related certificate files detected\n   [NOT FOUND] Certificate store not present: /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors\n\nCheck 2: DoD Root CA Detection (Deep Inspection)\n--------------------------------------------------\n   [NOT FOUND] No DoD Root CA certificates detected in system stores\n   Expected certificates: DoD Root CA 3, DoD Root CA 4, DoD Root CA 5, DoD Root CA 6\n\nCheck 3: XO Node.js Trust Store Configuration\n--------------------------------------------------\n   [NOT SET] NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS environment variable not configured\n   Node.js will use system-wide CA store only\n\n   [FOUND] XO service file: /etc/systemd/system/xo-server.service\n   [NOT FOUND] NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS not set in service file\n\nCheck 4: Certificate Chain Validation with DoD CAs\n--------------------------------------------------\n   [FOUND] XO TLS certificate: /etc/ssl/cert.pem\n   [PASS] Certificate chain validation successful\n   C = AU, ST = Some-State, O = Internet Widgits Pty Ltd error 18 at 0 depth lookup: self-signed certificate error /etc/ssl/cert.pem: verification failed\n   Certificate Issuer: issuer=C = AU, ST = Some-State, O = Internet Widgits Pty Ltd\n   [WARNING] Certificate not issued by DoD PKI\n\nCheck 5: Expired or Invalid CA Certificates\n--------------------------------------------------\n   [WARNING] Expired certificates detected in /etc/ssl/certs\n\"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\"\n   [WARNING] Expired certificates detected in /usr/share/ca-certificates\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/XRamp_Global_CA_Root.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/SSL.com_EV_Root_Certification_Authority_ECC.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/SecureSign_RootCA11.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/DigiCert_Assured_ID_Root_G3.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Certum_Trusted_Network_CA_2.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/ISRG_Root_X1.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/GTS_Root_R1.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/DigiCert_Trusted_Root_G4.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Starfield_Class_2_CA.crt\"\n\"/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Microsec_e-Szigno_Root_CA_2009.crt\"\n\n================================================================================\nDOD TRUST ANCHOR COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT\n================================================================================\n\nAUTOMATED CHECKS - NON-COMPLIANCE DETECTED:\n- [FAIL] No DoD Root CA certificates detected in system trust stores\n- [FAIL] System is using default/commercial CA trust anchors only\n\nMANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED:\n\n1.
