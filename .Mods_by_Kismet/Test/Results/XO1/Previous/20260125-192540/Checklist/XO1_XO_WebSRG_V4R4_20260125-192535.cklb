The automated check retrieves the most recent audit log entry, parses the Unix millisecond timestamp, and compares it to the current system time per STIG requirements.

The automated check verified one or more of the following: (1) Logout/signOut handlers found in XO source code (session.signOut, destroySession, invalidateSession), (2) Session management configured with Redis-based session store with automatic expiration, (3) XO REST API session management endpoint accessible and working, or (4) Redis server running as XO's session store backend. XO's default architecture uses Redis for session storage with built-in session.signOut() API endpoint that removes the session from the store when users log out. This ensures that session tokens cannot be reused after logout. STIG SRG-APP-000220-WSR-000201 requirement is satisfied. Technical basis: Proper session invalidation prevents session fixation attacks and ensures users cannot access protected resources with old session tokens after logout.\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_WebSRG_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 01/25/2026\nResultHash: 2EDAA7734727EEF7C36D5DF36125F899A5BCE797\n~~~~~\nVuln ID      : V-206396\nRule ID      : SV-206396r961248_rule\nSTIG ID      : SRG-APP-000220-WSR-000201\nRequirement  : The web server must invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.\nSeverity     : CAT II\n\n================================================================================\n\nCheck 1: XO Source Code Analysis\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   XO server code found: /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/\n   [FOUND] Logout handler pattern: 'signOut'\n     Locations:\n       /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/api/session.mjs:export function signOut() {\n       /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/api/session.mjs:signOut.description = 'sign out the user from the current session';\n       /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/api/session.mjs.map:{\"version\":3,\"file\":\"session.mjs\",\"names\":[\"deprecate\",\"getUserPublicProperties\",\"signIn\",\"credentials\",\"connection\",\"apiContext\",\"user\",\"expiration\",\"authenticateUser\",\"ip\",\"get\",\"undefined\",\"set\",\"id\",\"unset\",\"description\",\"permission\",\"signInWithPassword\",\"params\",\"email\",\"type\",\"password\",\"signInWithToken\",\"token\",\"signOut\",\"getUser\",\"userId\"],\"sources\":[\"../../src/api/session.mjs\"],\"sourcesContent\":[\"import { deprecate } from 'util'\\n\\nimport { getUserPublicProperties } from '../utils.mjs'\\n\\n// ===================================================================\\n\\nexport async function signIn(credentials) {\\n  const { connection } = this.apiContext\\n\\n  const { user, expiration } = await this.authenticateUser(credentials, {\\n    ip: connection.get('user_ip', undefined),\\n  })\\n\\n  connection.set('user_id', user.id)\\n\\n  if (expiration === undefined) {\\n    connection.unset('expiration')\\n  } else {\\n    connection.set('expiration', expiration)\\n  }\\n\\n  return getUserPublicProperties(user)\\n}\\n\\nsignIn.description = 'sign in'\\nsignIn.permission = null // user does not need to be authenticated\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport const signInWithPassword = deprecate(signIn, 'use session.signIn() instead')\\n\\nsignInWithPassword.params = {\\n  email: { type: 'string' },\\n  password: { type: 'string' },\\n}\\nsignInWithPassword.permission = null // user does not need to be authenticated\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport const signInWithToken = deprecate(signIn, 'use session.signIn() instead')\\n\\nsignInWithToken.params = {\\n  token: { type: 'string' },\\n}\\nsignInWithToken.permission = null // user does not need to be authenticated\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport function signOut() {\\n  this.apiContext.connection.unset('user_id')\\n}\\n\\nsignOut.description = 'sign out the user from the current session'\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport async function getUser() {\\n  const userId = this.apiContext.user.id\\n\\n  return userId === undefined ?

If any required attribute is missing, this indicates a configuration problem. \n\nRemediation: Edit /opt/xo/xo-server/config.toml, add [http.cookies] section with httpOnly=true, secure=true, sameSite=\"strict\", then restart xo-server service. Document findings with screenshots from browser DevTools showing cookie attributes. Contact Vates support if default cookie security is not working - XO should have these protections enabled by default.\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_WebSRG_Checks) found this to be OPEN on 01/25/2026\nResultHash: 79170DE2B9B64144CAF4A90FC61722D1BBB997F3\n~~~~~\nVuln ID      : V-206397\nRule ID      : SV-206397r961251_rule\nSTIG ID      : SRG-APP-000223-WSR-000011\nRequirement  : Cookies must have security settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) that disallow access outside the originating server.\nSeverity     : CAT II\n\n================================================================================\n\nCheck 1: XO Configuration File Analysis\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Config file found: /opt/xo/xo-server/config.toml\n   [INFO] No explicit cookie security config found - using XO defaults\n   XO default behavior: HttpOnly and Secure flags enabled for session cookies\n\nCheck 2: HTTP Response Header Analysis\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   XO server responding at: https://localhost\n   [SUCCESS] Set-Cookie headers retrieved\n   Headers:\n     Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A8_6aaDfWBO5Z7UhvRlwjUwCJA0nUyYoq.ZiBuokLyuRE9xKkxPU2DJSGk26wFXke6x9FhPCbdvk0; Path=/; HttpOnly\n   [FOUND] HttpOnly flag present in cookies\n   [NOT FOUND] Secure flag missing from cookies\n   [NOT FOUND] SameSite attribute missing from cookies\n\nCheck 3: XO Default Behavior Verification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   [FOUND] XO server process running\n   XO Architecture: Built on Express.js framework\n   Default Cookie Security:\n     - HttpOnly: Enabled by default for session cookies (prevents XSS access)\n     - Secure: Enabled when HTTPS is used (prevents transmission over HTTP)\n     - SameSite: Typically 'Lax' or 'Strict' (prevents CSRF attacks)\n\nCheck 4: Runtime Cookie Testing Guidance\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Manual verification procedure:\n     1.

Time service can be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the capabilities.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","ccis":["CCI-004922"],"reference_identifier":"2910","uuid":"c843f50f-a84c-47e5-b1ec-452f5a8997ea","stig_uuid":"2418fd6a-d129-4656-8a3a-4eaecabe2d40","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 01/25/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: '/tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml'\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 01/25/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: '/tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml'\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-264359","group_tree":[{"id":"V-264359","title":"SRG-APP-000925","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-264359","severity":"medium","group_title":"The web server must compare the internal system clocks on an organization-defined frequency with organization-defined authoritative time source.","rule_id_src":"SV-264359r984422_rule","rule_id":"SV-264359r984422","rule_version":"SRG-APP-000925-WSR-000330","rule_title":"The web server must compare the internal system clocks on an organization-defined frequency with organization-defined authoritative time source.","fix_text":"Configure the web server to compare the internal system clocks on an organization-defined frequency with organization-defined authoritative time source.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the web server is configured to compare the internal system clocks on an organization-defined frequency with organization-defined authoritative time source.\n\nIf the web server is not configured to compare the internal system clocks on an organization-defined frequency with organization-defined authoritative time source, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"Web_Server_SRG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"UNCLASSIFIED","discussion":"Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","ccis":["CCI-004923"],"reference_identifier":"2910","uuid":"bab7d131-1512-4af2-a516-5873e286f6b4","stig_uuid":"2418fd6a-d129-4656-8a3a-4eaecabe2d40","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 01/25/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: '/tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml'\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 01/25/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: '/tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml'\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-264360","group_tree":[{"id":"V-264360","title":"SRG-APP-000219","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-264360","severity":"medium","group_title":"The web server must restrict a consistent inbound source IP for the entire management session.","rule_id_src":"SV-264360r1043178_rule","rule_id":"SV-264360r1043178","rule_version":"SRG-APP-000219-WSR-000190","rule_title":"The web server must restrict a consistent inbound source IP for the entire management session.","fix_text":"Configure the web server to restrict the management session to a consistent inbound IP for the entire management session.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the web server limits authenticated client management sessions to initial session source IP.\n\nIf the web server does not limit authenticated client management sessions to initial session source IP, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"Web_Server_SRG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"UNCLASSIFIED","discussion":"Authenticity protection provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.\n\nApplication communication sessions are protected utilizing transport encryption protocols, such as TLS.
