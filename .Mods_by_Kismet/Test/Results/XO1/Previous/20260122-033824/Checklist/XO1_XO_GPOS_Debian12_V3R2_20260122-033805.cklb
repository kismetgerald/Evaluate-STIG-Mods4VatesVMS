A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.\n\nA comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nThe automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nAccount management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70831","V-56571"],"ccis":["CCI-000015"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"1ebb082d-0388-4cb7-b5ee-8bde73d979b7","stig_uuid":"a0588b03-d10d-4602-9723-540408bc9f61","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-203592","group_tree":[{"id":"V-203592","title":"SRG-OS-000002","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-203592","severity":"medium","group_title":"The operating system must automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.","rule_id_src":"SV-203592r958364_rule","rule_id":"SV-203592r958364","rule_version":"SRG-OS-000002-GPOS-00002","rule_title":"The operating system must automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.","fix_text":"Configure the operating system to automatically remove or disable local temporary user accounts after 72 hours.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the operating system automatically removes or disables local temporary user accounts after 72 hours.

Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.\n\nSynchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. Organizations should consider setting time periods for different types of systems (e.g., financial, legal, or mission-critical systems).\n\nOrganizations should also consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). This requirement is related to the comparison done every 24 hours in SRG-OS-000355 because a comparison must be done in order to determine the time difference.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-71463","V-57203"],"ccis":["CCI-004926"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"65d01bcb-97c3-4e77-91e3-4be6eaa68e86","stig_uuid":"a0588b03-d10d-4602-9723-540408bc9f61","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-203713","group_tree":[{"id":"V-203713","title":"SRG-OS-000358","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-203713","severity":"medium","group_title":"The operating system must record time stamps for audit records that meet a minimum granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.","rule_id_src":"SV-203713r958786_rule","rule_id":"SV-203713r958786","rule_version":"SRG-OS-000358-GPOS-00145","rule_title":"The operating system must record time stamps for audit records that meet a minimum granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.","fix_text":"Configure the operating system to record time stamps for audit records that meet a minimum granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the operating system records time stamps for audit records that meet a minimum granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.
