This requirement limits the ability of adversaries from capturing and continuing to employ previously valid session IDs.\n\nSession IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the web server must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70275","V-56021"],"ccis":["CCI-001185"],"reference_identifier":"2910","uuid":"ee59b740-0370-42c0-827e-2d0467938502","stig_uuid":"5fe0edb5-9e90-4964-96f1-c0cc1e3d5781","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 01/31/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_WebSRG_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nXen Orchestra web server properly invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination. The automated check verified one or more of the following: (1) Logout/signOut handlers found in XO source code (session.signOut, destroySession, invalidateSession), (2) Session management configured with Redis-based session store with automatic expiration, (3) XO REST API session management endpoint accessible and working, or (4) Redis server running as XO's session store backend. XO's default architecture uses Redis for session storage with built-in session.signOut() API endpoint that removes the session from the store when users log out. This ensures that session tokens cannot be reused after logout. STIG SRG-APP-000220-WSR-000201 requirement is satisfied. Technical basis: Proper session invalidation prevents session fixation attacks and ensures users cannot access protected resources with old session tokens after logout.\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_WebSRG_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 01/31/2026\nResultHash: 2EDAA7734727EEF7C36D5DF36125F899A5BCE797\n~~~~~\nVuln ID      : V-206396\nRule ID      : SV-206396r961248_rule\nSTIG ID      : SRG-APP-000220-WSR-000201\nRequirement  : The web server must invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.\nSeverity     : CAT II\n\n================================================================================\n\nCheck 1: XO Source Code Analysis\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   XO server code found: /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/\n   [FOUND] Logout handler pattern: 'signOut'\n     Locations:\n       /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/api/session.mjs:export function signOut() {\n       /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/api/session.mjs:signOut.description = 'sign out the user from the current session';\n       /opt/xo/xo-server/dist/api/session.mjs.map:{\"version\":3,\"file\":\"session.mjs\",\"names\":[\"deprecate\",\"getUserPublicProperties\",\"signIn\",\"credentials\",\"connection\",\"apiContext\",\"user\",\"expiration\",\"authenticateUser\",\"ip\",\"get\",\"undefined\",\"set\",\"id\",\"unset\",\"description\",\"permission\",\"signInWithPassword\",\"params\",\"email\",\"type\",\"password\",\"signInWithToken\",\"token\",\"signOut\",\"getUser\",\"userId\"],\"sources\":[\"../../src/api/session.mjs\"],\"sourcesContent\":[\"import { deprecate } from 'util'\\n\\nimport { getUserPublicProperties } from '../utils.mjs'\\n\\n// ===================================================================\\n\\nexport async function signIn(credentials) {\\n  const { connection } = this.apiContext\\n\\n  const { user, expiration } = await this.authenticateUser(credentials, {\\n    ip: connection.get('user_ip', undefined),\\n  })\\n\\n  connection.set('user_id', user.id)\\n\\n  if (expiration === undefined) {\\n    connection.unset('expiration')\\n  } else {\\n    connection.set('expiration', expiration)\\n  }\\n\\n  return getUserPublicProperties(user)\\n}\\n\\nsignIn.description = 'sign in'\\nsignIn.permission = null // user does not need to be authenticated\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport const signInWithPassword = deprecate(signIn, 'use session.signIn() instead')\\n\\nsignInWithPassword.params = {\\n  email: { type: 'string' },\\n  password: { type: 'string' },\\n}\\nsignInWithPassword.permission = null // user does not need to be authenticated\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport const signInWithToken = deprecate(signIn, 'use session.signIn() instead')\\n\\nsignInWithToken.params = {\\n  token: { type: 'string' },\\n}\\nsignInWithToken.permission = null // user does not need to be authenticated\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport function signOut() {\\n  this.apiContext.connection.unset('user_id')\\n}\\n\\nsignOut.description = 'sign out the user from the current session'\\n\\n// -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nexport async function getUser() {\\n  const userId = this.apiContext.user.id\\n\\n  return userId === undefined ?

Organizational patch management policy requires monthly review of vendor security bulletins and timely application of critical updates within SLA requirements. Software lifecycle management process ensures proactive identification of approaching End-of-Life dates with minimum 90-day advance planning for version upgrades. All version updates are tested in development environment before production deployment per change management procedures. Current software inventory is documented and maintained in organizational CMDB with automated alerting for EOL notifications.\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_WebSRG_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 01/31/2026\nResultHash: 8F613363B182AC27AF1B44EFDED7F8B232346B91\n~~~~~\n=== Vendor-Supported Software Version Check ===\n\n1.
