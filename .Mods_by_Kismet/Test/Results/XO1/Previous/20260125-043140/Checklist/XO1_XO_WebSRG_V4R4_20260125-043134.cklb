Listening on all interfaces allows access via any network interface (production, management, backup networks, etc.), which may enable unauthorized access paths. Remediation steps: (1) Determine if this system uses DHCP (ip -4 addr show | grep dynamic). (2a) For STATIC IP systems: Edit /opt/xo/xo-server/.config/xo-server/config.toml and add '[http] \\n listen = \"SPECIFIC_IP:PORT\"' (e.g., 10.0.10.50:80). (2b) For DHCP systems: Either bind to localhost if behind reverse proxy '[http] \\n listen = \"127.0.0.1:80\"', OR use interface-based binding that updates with DHCP renewal. (3) Restart xo-server: systemctl restart xo-server. (4) Verify with 'ss -tlnp | grep xo-server' - should NOT show 0.0.0.0 or ::.
