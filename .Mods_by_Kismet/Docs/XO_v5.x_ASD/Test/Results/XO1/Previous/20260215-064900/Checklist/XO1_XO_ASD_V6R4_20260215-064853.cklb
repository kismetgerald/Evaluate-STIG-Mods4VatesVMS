The testing must cover all aspects and components of the application architecture.  If an application consists of a web server and a database, then both components must be tested for vulnerabilities to the fullest extent possible.\n\nVulnerability assessment tests normally utilize a combination of specialized software called application vulnerability scanners as well as custom scripts and manual tests.  In some instances, multiple tools are required in order to test all aspects of application features, functions and architecture.  The vulnerability scanner is typically configured to communicate with the application through the user interface or via an applications communication port.  In addition to using automated tools, manual tests conducted from the OS console such as executing custom scripts or reviewing configuration settings for known vulnerabilities may also be included as part of the test.\n\nTesters will typically utilize application user test accounts in order to test application features and functionality such as adding content, executing queries and completing transactions. The vulnerability testing software utilizes user actions and access as well as a list of known security vulnerabilities in order to detect and identify weak security controls or misconfigurations that could potentially be manipulated by the user or create a security vulnerability.\n\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 for 2013 includes the following top issues that should be tested.

If passwords are stored in clear text, they can be plainly read and easily compromised.\n\nIn many instances, verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. \n\nA more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random SALT value as follows:\n\nH0 = H(pwd, H(salt))\nHn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))\n\nWhere n is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. Hn is stored, along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares Hn with the stored Hn.\n\nA SALT is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically-strong random value. \n\nAnother method used is utilizing a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key.\n \nApplications must only store passwords that have been cryptographically protected.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-84189","V-69567"],"ccis":["CCI-000196","CCI-004062"],"reference_identifier":"4093","uuid":"48317ec9-2d2a-4445-bc28-d0b62ec387b5","stig_uuid":"c1a1a47a-6931-42c3-a6f8-57a0d440f847","status":"open","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_ASD_Checks) found this to be OPEN on 02/15/2026\nResultHash: C16270025988D0C3785117D125F3596924BD6E62\n~~~~~\nV-222542: Password Storage - Cryptographic Representations Only\n======================================================================\n\n1.

Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.\n\nBuffer overflows can manifest as stack overflows, heap overflows integer overflows and format string overflows. Each type of overflow is dependent upon the underlying application language and the context in which the overflow is executed.\n\nInteger overflows can lead to infinite looping when loop index variables are compromised and cause a denial of service.  If the integer is used in data references, the data can become corrupt. Also, using the integer in memory allocation can cause buffer overflows, and a denial of service.  Integers used in access control mechanisms can potentially trigger buffer overflows, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. \n\nAlmost all known web servers, application servers, and web application environments are susceptible to buffer overflows.

Automated scanning tools expedite and help to standardize security testing, they can incorporate known attack methods and procedures, test for libraries and other software modules known to be vulnerable to attack and utilize a test method known as \"fuzz testing\". Fuzz testing is a testing process where the application is provided invalid, unexpected, or random data. Poorly designed and coded applications will become unstable or crash. Properly designed and coded applications will reject improper and unexpected data input from application clients and remain stable.\n\nMany vulnerability scanning tools provide automated fuzz testing capabilities for the testing of web applications. All of these tools help to identify a wide range of application vulnerabilities including, but not limited to; buffer overflows, cross-site scripting flaws, denial of service format bugs and SQL injection, all of which can lead to a successful compromise of the system or result in a denial of service.\n\nDue to changes in the production environment, it is a good practice to schedule periodic active testing of production web applications. Ideally, this will occur prior to deployment and after updates or changes to the application production environment.\n\nIt is imperative that automated scanning tools are configured properly to ensure that all of the application components that can be tested are tested. In the case of web applications, some of the application code base may be accessible on the website and could potentially be corrected by a knowledgeable system administrator. Active testing is different from code review testing in that active testing does not require access to the application source code base.

It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.\n\nThreat modeling can optimize application security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.\n\nThe lack of threat modeling will potentially leave unidentified threats for attackers to utilize to gain access to the application. To execute a threat model you should do the following:\n\n- Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat modeling process is gaining an understanding of the application and how it interacts with external entities. This includes identifying application components such as web server, application server, database server and languages used by the application. It also includes identifying network connections and the means utilized to access the application.\n\n- Determine and rank threats. Use a threat categorization methodology to understand the different threat categories.\nE.g., Auditing, authentication, configuration management and data protection. The goal of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the attacker perspective and the defensive perspective.\n\n- Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.\n\nCountermeasures could include using application firewalls, IDS/IPS to block or identify known attacks against the architecture and alarming on audit log events.\n\nRefer to the OWASP website for additional details on application threat modeling.\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-85011","V-70389"],"ccis":["CCI-003256"],"reference_identifier":"4093","uuid":"e3cd8f41-8c0d-4e26-8155-377bdadb22bf","stig_uuid":"c1a1a47a-6931-42c3-a6f8-57a0d440f847","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_ASD_Checks) was unable to determine a Status but found the below configuration on 02/15/2026:\nResultHash: FDD221E9AB7C0D9723F3F26C89693898D257BB82\n~~~~~\nThis check requires manual review of Xen Orchestra application security configuration.
