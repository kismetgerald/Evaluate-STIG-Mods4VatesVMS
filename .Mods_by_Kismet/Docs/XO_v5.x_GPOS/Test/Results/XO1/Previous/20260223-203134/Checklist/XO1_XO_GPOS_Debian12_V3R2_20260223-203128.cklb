A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.\n\nA comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nThe automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nAccount management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70831","V-56571"],"ccis":["CCI-000015"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"86dc3761-62ea-48eb-a2fd-1719768b4899","stig_uuid":"62dbed10-526c-410d-9377-167a1c3b9e48","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 02/23/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: '/tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml'\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n","finding_details":"*** Scan-XO_GPOS_Debian12_Checks (Get-V203591) : Failed. ***\nUsername: root\nResultHash: A6E3432C4BB085B8F1911C0A373103FAC7D81CC8\n~~~~~\nTimeStamp : 02/23/2026 20:29:30\nMessage : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'StigType'.\nCategory : InvalidArgument\nReason : ParameterBindingException\nTargetName : \nFullyQualified : NamedParameterNotFound,Get-V203591\nScriptName : \nLine : 1\nColumn : 16\nLineText : Try {$Result = Get-V203591 -ScanType Classified -AnswerFile '/tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml' -AnswerKey XO -Username root -UserSID NA} Catch {$Result = @{CodeFail = $true; ErrorData = $_; Status=\"Not_Reviewed\"}}; Return $Result\nExceptionType : System.Management.Automation.ParameterBindingException\nHResult : 0x80131501\nScriptStackTrace : at Get-V203591, /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/Modules/Scan-XO_GPOS_Debian12_Checks/Scan-XO_GPOS_Debian12_Checks.psm1: line 278\nat <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\nWasTerminating : False\nComputer : \nParentFunctionName : Invoke-STIGScan\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-203592","group_tree":[{"id":"V-203592","title":"SRG-OS-000002","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-203592","severity":"medium","group_title":"The operating system must automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.","rule_id_src":"SV-203592r958364_rule","rule_id":"SV-203592r958364","rule_version":"SRG-OS-000002-GPOS-00002","rule_title":"The operating system must automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.","fix_text":"Configure the operating system to automatically remove or disable local temporary user accounts after 72 hours.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the operating system automatically removes or disables local temporary user accounts after 72 hours.

It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.\n\nWhen there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.\n\nThis requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.

Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.\n\nDevelopers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries.
