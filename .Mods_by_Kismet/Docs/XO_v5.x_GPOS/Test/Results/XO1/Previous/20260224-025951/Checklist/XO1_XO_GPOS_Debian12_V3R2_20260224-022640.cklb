A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.\n\nA comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nThe automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nAccount management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70831","V-56571"],"ccis":["CCI-000015"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"28b704ae-78f5-49df-9a4e-cc9377193f8b","stig_uuid":"31c7fecd-f3dd-48b0-a2c5-380a077f1047","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 02/24/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_GPOS_Debian12_Checks) was unable to determine a Status but found the below configuration on 02/24/2026:\nResultHash: 1C62FA910E2CE88E3DAB7C496968065BE526D001\n~~~~~\nThis check requires manual review of Debian 12 system configuration.

Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds.
