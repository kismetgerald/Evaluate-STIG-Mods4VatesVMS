A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.\n\nA comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nThe automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nAccount management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70831","V-56571"],"ccis":["CCI-000015"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"a731c18d-cf32-40bc-ad97-8b9278b4f186","stig_uuid":"fb2b64ee-da8a-485b-ab8c-12109bd86f7a","status":"open","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 03/01/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 2\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nThe system does not have centralized account management configured.\n\nThe automated check did not detect SSSD, LDAP, or nslcd integration for centralized account management.

Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the Unix OS \"root\" user account, the Windows \"Administrator\" account, the \"sa\" account, or a \"helpdesk\" account.\n\nFor example, the Unix and Windows operating systems offer a \"switch user\" capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, \"switch\" to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.\n\nUsers (and any processes acting on behalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification or authentication.\n\nRequiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as well as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group account knowledge.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-71023","V-56763"],"ccis":["CCI-004045"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"45bb15db-6710-4604-a1e4-fe976b4ee763","stig_uuid":"fb2b64ee-da8a-485b-ab8c-12109bd86f7a","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 03/01/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nIndividual authentication is required before group account access on this Xen Orchestra system.\n\nEvidence may include one or more of:\n(1) PAM configured to enforce individual authentication before sudo/su\n(2) No direct group account login permitted (service accounts use /usr/sbin/nologin)\n(3) sudo configured with individual user entries for accountability\n(4) XO auth-ldap plugin active  individual AD credentials required before any XO access\n\nCOMPENSATING CONTROL (AD/LDAP): When the XO auth-ldap plugin is active, all users must authenticate with their individual Active Directory credentials before accessing Xen Orchestra.

Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.\n\nProtecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

Denial of service or failure to deny expired credentials may result without properly synchronized clocks within and between systems and system components. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities—such as access control and identification and authentication—depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the capabilities.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","ccis":["CCI-004922"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"daeece9b-7cc3-4cca-a0fd-e63922846fdb","stig_uuid":"fb2b64ee-da8a-485b-ab8c-12109bd86f7a","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 03/01/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\n\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_GPOS_Debian12_Checks) was unable to determine a Status but found the below configuration on 03/01/2026:\nResultHash: EA0ED941F771A9AB57301526950C0CC8E8E86F0B\n~~~~~\nThis check requires manual review of Debian 12 system configuration.
