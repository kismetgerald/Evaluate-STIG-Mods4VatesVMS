A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.\n\nA comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nThe automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nAccount management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-70831","V-56571"],"ccis":["CCI-000015"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"dd5cfd3e-3e8c-463d-b064-c96657036e11","stig_uuid":"675bd2eb-7c38-4dda-b27f-09c10c97eed7","status":"open","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 03/01/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 2\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nThe system does not have centralized account management configured.\n\nThe automated check did not detect SSSD, LDAP, or nslcd integration for centralized account management.

This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.\n\nUsers (and any processes acting on behalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification or authentication.\n\nRequiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as well as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group account knowledge.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-71023","V-56763"],"ccis":["CCI-004045"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"1cbcebd1-6247-42fc-9625-d22c39eb868a","stig_uuid":"675bd2eb-7c38-4dda-b27f-09c10c97eed7","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 03/01/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nIndividual authentication is required before group account access on this Xen Orchestra system.\n\nEvidence may include one or more of:\n(1) PAM configured to enforce individual authentication before sudo/su\n(2) No direct group account login permitted (service accounts use /usr/sbin/nologin)\n(3) sudo configured with individual user entries for accountability\n(4) XO auth-ldap plugin active  individual AD credentials required before any XO access\n\nCOMPENSATING CONTROL (AD/LDAP): When the XO auth-ldap plugin is active, all users must authenticate with their individual Active Directory credentials before accessing Xen Orchestra.

A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet).\n\nBecause of the challenges of applying this requirement on a large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply this requirement to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-71067","V-56807"],"ccis":["CCI-001967"],"reference_identifier":"2895","uuid":"a04c9a2d-18dc-40d2-b035-b084f88eb17d","stig_uuid":"675bd2eb-7c38-4dda-b27f-09c10c97eed7","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"Evaluate-STIG answer file is providing the below comment on 03/01/2026:\r\n\nAnswer File: /tmp/Evaluate-STIG_RemoteComputer/AnswerFiles/XO_v5.x_GPOS_Debian12_AnswerFile.xml\r\nKey Name: XO\r\nIndex: 1\r\n\r\n[ValidTrueComment]:\r\nThe operating system authenticates all endpoint devices using bidirectional cryptographic authentication.\n\nAutomated scan verified:\n- SSH host keys provide server-to-client authentication (host key verification)\n- TLS certificate on port 443 authenticates XO server to connecting clients\n- Client authentication via password or public key over encrypted SSH channel\n- XO authentication (username/password or LDAP/SAML) over encrypted TLS channel\n\nBidirectional cryptographic authentication is implemented: servers authenticate to clients via SSH host keys and TLS certificates, clients authenticate to servers via credentials over encrypted channels.\n\nISSO/ISSM: Verify SSH host keys and TLS certificates are from trusted sources and properly maintained.\n\n","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2507.6 (Scan-XO_GPOS_Debian12_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 03/01/2026\nResultHash: 8C200754B0F3C6112C2BF45EA2200CFCA17EB73E\n~~~~~\n--- Check: Bidirectional Cryptographic Endpoint Authentication ---\n\nCheck 1: SSH Host Key Authentication\n  SSH host public keys: 3 found\n    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub\n    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub\n    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\n\nCheck 2: TLS Server Certificate\n  subject=C = AU, ST = Some-State, O = Internet Widgits Pty Ltd\n  issuer=C = AU, ST = Some-State, O = Internet Widgits Pty Ltd\n\nCheck 3: Client Authentication\n  SSH: Password or public key (client authenticates to server)\n  XO: Username/password or LDAP/SAML (client authenticates to server)\n  Both directions: cryptographic channel (SSH/TLS) protects exchange\n\nRESULT: Bidirectional cryptographic authentication is implemented.\n  Server: SSH host keys + TLS certificate authenticate server to client.\n  Client: Password/key over encrypted channel authenticates client.\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-203733","group_tree":[{"id":"V-203733","title":"SRG-OS-000383","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-203733","severity":"medium","group_title":"The operating system must prohibit the use of cached authenticators after one day.","rule_id_src":"SV-203733r958828_rule","rule_id":"SV-203733r958828","rule_version":"SRG-OS-000383-GPOS-00166","rule_title":"The operating system must prohibit the use of cached authenticators after one day.","fix_text":"Configure the operating system to prohibit the use of cached authenticators after one day.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify the operating system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after one day.
