STIG Requirement: Non-privileged user sessions must time out after 15 minutes of inactivity (APSC-DV-000070).

Xen Orchestra does not natively expose a configurable idle session timeout in config.toml or via environment variable.
The check searched config.toml, process environment, and XO source for sessionTimeout, idleTimeout, or token
expiration settings. No qualifying 15-minute inactivity timeout was detected.

Remediation options:
1. Configure a reverse proxy (nginx) in front of XO to enforce session idle timeouts using proxy_read_timeout
   and proxy_send_timeout directives set to 900 seconds (15 minutes).
2. Implement network-level session enforcement via firewall idle-connection timeout rules.
3. Contact Vates to request a configurable session idle timeout feature in a future XO release.
4. Document a compensating control accepted by the AO if a technical solution is not feasible.

STIG Requirement: Administrator sessions must time out after 10 minutes of inactivity (APSC-DV-000080).

Xen Orchestra applies a single session expiration policy to all users and does not differentiate between
administrator and non-privileged user sessions. The check found no per-role idle timeout configuration
in config.toml, process environment, or source. The 10-minute administrator timeout requirement cannot
be enforced through native XO configuration.

Remediation options:
1. Implement differentiated timeout enforcement via a reverse proxy (nginx) or load balancer that
   applies shorter session timeouts to administrative URL paths (e.g., /api/admin/*).
2. Configure administrative access through a privileged access workstation (PAW) or jump server
   that enforces 10-minute idle lockouts at the OS level.
3. Contact Vates to request role-based session timeout support in a future XO release.
4. Document this as an accepted risk with compensating controls in the SSP.

STIG Requirement: The application must provide a user-initiated logoff capability (APSC-DV-000090).

Xen Orchestra provides a built-in logoff capability through multiple mechanisms:
- Web UI: Sign Out button accessible from the user menu in the top navigation bar terminates the session.
- REST API: The /rest/v0/sessions/current endpoint accepts DELETE requests to invalidate the current session.
- XO CLI: The xo-cli session.signOut command terminates the authenticated session programmatically.

Session termination is confirmed by verifying that authenticated API requests return HTTP 401 after logout.
XO uses server-side session tokens stored in LevelDB; logout invalidates the token server-side, preventing reuse.

This finding is Not A Finding. Xen Orchestra fully satisfies the logoff capability requirement.

STIG Requirement: The application must provide a user-initiated logoff capability (APSC-DV-000090).

The automated check could not confirm XO's logout capability on this system. Possible causes:
- XO process is not running or is not accessible on port 443.
- The REST API endpoint /rest/v0/sessions/current is not responding.
- XO is deployed behind a proxy that is filtering the check.

Manual verification steps:
1. Log in to the Xen Orchestra web interface.
2. Confirm a Sign Out or Logout option is present in the user menu.
3. Click Sign Out and verify you are redirected to the login page.
4. Attempt to access a protected resource after logout and confirm HTTP 401 is returned.

If manual verification confirms logout works, document the evidence and mark as NotAFinding in the CKL.

STIG Requirement: The application must display an explicit logoff message confirming session termination (APSC-DV-000100, CAT III).

The automated check searched the xo-web compiled JavaScript distribution for explicit session-terminated
confirmation messages (e.g., "You have been logged out", "Session terminated"). While XO redirects users
to the login page after logout, no explicit confirmation message text was detected in the source.

Manual verification steps:
1. Log in to the Xen Orchestra web interface.
2. Click Sign Out from the user menu.
3. Observe whether the application displays a message such as "You have been signed out" or "Session terminated
   successfully" before or after redirecting to the login page.
4. If such a message is displayed, document it with a screenshot and mark as NotAFinding.
5. If no message is displayed (only a redirect to login), this remains an Open finding.

Remediation: Request Vates add an explicit logout confirmation message to the XO web interface.
This is a CAT III (low severity) finding. Document as accepted risk if remediation is not feasible.

Not Applicable: Xen Orchestra is a hypervisor management platform that manages VMs, hosts, and storage.
It does not store or process classified, CUI, or user-defined data objects requiring security attribute
labeling (e.g., classification markings). The STIG requires security attribute association only for
applications that store data subject to mandatory access control (MAC) or sensitivity labeling policies.
XO stores infrastructure configuration data (VM configs, user credentials, audit logs), not mission data.
This requirement does not apply to infrastructure management software of this type.

Not Applicable: Xen Orchestra does not process classified, CUI, or sensitivity-labeled data objects
requiring in-process security attribute association. XO processes infrastructure management data
(API requests, VM operations, host metrics) that does not carry data classification markings.
This STIG control applies to applications that process data subject to mandatory access control (MAC)
policies where security attributes (classification, sensitivity labels) must be tracked through
processing pipelines. XO is an infrastructure management tool, not a data processing application

Not Applicable: Xen Orchestra does not transmit classified, CUI, or sensitivity-labeled data objects
requiring security attribute association during transmission. XO transmits infrastructure management
data (API responses, VM state, metrics) over TLS-protected channels, but this data does not carry
mandatory access control (MAC) classification labels that must travel with the data.

TLS confidentiality and integrity protection for XO API transmissions is covered separately by
V-222396 (confidentiality) and V-222397 (integrity). This control specifically requires applications
to embed and preserve data classification attributes (e.g., FOUO, SECRET) in transmitted messages.
As an infrastructure management tool, XO does not handle data subject to this labeling requirement.

STIG Requirement: DoD-approved encryption (TLS 1.2 or higher) must protect all remote access sessions (APSC-DV-000160).

The automated check confirmed that Xen Orchestra accepts TLS 1.2 and/or TLS 1.3 connections on port 443,
and TLS 1.0 (weak protocol) is disabled. This satisfies the DoD requirement for FIPS 140-2 approved
encryption protecting session confidentiality.

TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 use AES-based cipher suites which are FIPS 140-2 approved. TLS 1.0 is disabled,
eliminating known weaknesses (e.g., POODLE, BEAST). All XO API and web UI traffic is encrypted end-to-end.

STIG Requirement: DoD-approved encryption (TLS 1.2 or higher) must protect all remote access sessions (APSC-DV-000160).

The automated check detected one of the following conditions:
- TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are not active on port 443 (TLS not configured or not accessible).
- TLS 1.0 is active alongside TLS 1.2/1.3 (weak protocol must be disabled).

Remediation steps:
1. Verify XO is listening on port 443: ss -tlnp | grep :443
2. Review config.toml for TLS certificate configuration (bindAddress, certificate, key fields).
3. Disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in the Node.js TLS configuration using --tls-min-v1.2 flag
   or by setting minVersion: 'TLSv1.2' in the https.createServer options.
4. Restart the xo-server service: systemctl restart xo-server

STIG Requirement: Cryptographic mechanisms must protect the integrity of all remote access sessions (APSC-DV-000170).

The automated check confirmed that Xen Orchestra accepts TLS 1.2 and/or TLS 1.3 connections on port 443,
and TLS 1.0 (which lacks adequate integrity protection) is disabled.

TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 use HMAC-based message authentication (e.g., HMAC-SHA256 in TLS 1.2, AEAD in TLS 1.3)
to ensure integrity of all transmitted data. Any in-transit modification of encrypted TLS records is
detected and the connection is terminated. This satisfies the DoD requirement for cryptographic integrity

Not Applicable: Xen Orchestra does not use SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for any of its interfaces.

XO exposes a REST/JSON API over HTTPS and a WebSocket JSON-RPC interface. Both are modern protocols
that do not use XML-based SOAP messaging. Node.js/Express.js applications do not natively support SOAP.
No SOAP, WSDL, or XML-RPC references were detected in the XO source code.

The STIG requirement applies only to applications that use SOAP messaging. Since XO does not use SOAP,
this control does not apply. TLS-based integrity for XO's REST and WebSocket interfaces is covered
by V-222397. This finding is Not Applicable.

The automated check detected potential SOAP, WSDL, or XML-RPC references in the Xen Orchestra source code.

Manual verification required:
1. Review the detected references to determine if they represent active SOAP endpoints or merely
   code comments, documentation, or library imports.
2. If active SOAP messaging is confirmed, verify that all SOAP messages include:
   - Message ID
   - Service Request element
   - Timestamp element
   - SAML Assertion (if applicable)
   - Digital signatures on all message elements
3. If no active SOAP endpoints are found, update the finding to Not_Applicable with supporting evidence.

If SOAP is confirmed but not properly secured, contact Vates to implement WS-Security digital signing.
